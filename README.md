# EventManager Project

This is a project that is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization) created by [Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html)

## Pre-Project Thoughts

This project is primarily a walk-through, so it should be straightforward.

The learning goals are to be able to:
* manipulate file I/O
* read content from a CSV file
* transform CSV data into a standardized format
* utilize the data to contact a remote service
* populate a template with user data
* manipulate strings
* access Sunlight's Congressional API through the Sunlight Congress gem
* use ERB (Embedded Ruby) for templating

## Post-Project Thoughts

1. One interesting concept from the project: "Look for a Solution before Building a Solution." Considering the Open Source Community and Ruby's ecosystem, I fully agree with this. It essentially is another way to say: "Don't reinvent the wheel." However, you have to consider the pros/cons, where the 'pro' is the ease of use, but the 'con' is learning how the solution was implemented.

2. The magic of how APIs work has been dispelled from my system. I now understand the mechanics.
