# EventManager Project

This is a project that is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization) created by [Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html)

## Installation

The project is currently incomplete.

## Pre-Project Thoughts

This project is primarily a walk-through, so it should be straightforward.

The learning goals are to be able to:
* manipulate file I/O
* read content from a CSV file
* transform CSV data into a standardized format
* utilize the data to contact a remote service
* populate a template with user data
* manipulate strings
* access Sunlight's Congressional API through the Sunlight Congress gem
* use ERB (Embedded Ruby) for templating

## Post-Project Thoughts

The project is currently incomplete.
